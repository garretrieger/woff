<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This document specifies the WOFF font packaging format.
This format was designed to provide lightweight, easy-to-implement compression of font data,
suitable for use with CSS <tt>@font-face</tt> rules.
Any properly licensed TrueType/OpenType/Open Font Format file can be packaged in WOFF format for Web use.
User agents decode the WOFF file to restore the original font data
such that it will display identically to the original desktop font
from which it was created.</p>

<p>The WOFF format also allows additional metadata to be attached to the file;
this can be used by font designers or vendors to include licensing or other information,
beyond that present in the original font.
Such metadata does not affect the rendering of the font in any way,
but may be displayed to the user on request.</p>

<p>The WOFF format is not intended to replace other formats
such as TrueType/OpenType/Open Font Format or SVG fonts,
but provides an alternative solution for use cases where these formats may be less optimal,
or where licensing considerations make their use less acceptable.</p>

<h2 id="Introduction">1.&nbsp;Introduction</h2>

<p>This document specifies a simple compressed file format for fonts, designed
primarily for use on the web and known as WOFF (Web Open Font Format).
Despite this name, WOFF should be regarded as a container format
or "wrapper" for font data in already-existing formats
rather than an actual font format in its own right.</p>

<p>The WOFF format is a container for the
table-based sfnt structure used in TrueType<a id="fn-1-ref" href="#fn-1"
title="footnote 1" class="fnref">[1]</a>, OpenType<a id="fn-2-ref" href="#fn-2"
title="footnote 2" class="fnref">[2]</a> and Open Font Format<a id="fn-3-ref"
href="#fn-3" title="footnote 3" class="fnref">[3]</a> fonts, which are
collectively referred to as sfnt-based fonts. A WOFF file is simply a repackaged
version of a sfnt-based font with optional compression of the font data tables.
The WOFF file format also allows font metadata and private-use data to be
included separately from the font data. WOFF encoding tools convert an existing
sfnt-based font into a WOFF formatted file, and user agents restore the original
sfnt-based font data for use with a web page.</p>

<p>In general, the structure and contents of decoded font data exactly match
those of the original font file. Tools producing WOFF files may provide other
font editing features such as glyph subsetting, validation or font feature
additions but these are considered outside the scope of this format. Independent
of these features, both tools and user agents are expected to assure that the validity of
the underlying font data is preserved.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of the WOFF format is to package fonts linked to web pages
by means of CSS <tt>@font-face</tt> rules.
When using such fonts, user agents MUST implement a 'same-origin restriction'
on the downloading of WOFF files
using the same-origin matching algorithm described in the HTML5 specification<a id="fn-4-ref" href="#fn-4"
title="footnote 4" class="fnref">[4]</a>.
Note that the origin of the stylesheet containing <tt>@font-face</tt> declarations
is not used when deciding whether a WOFF file is same-origin or not,
only the origin of containing document is used.
User agents MUST also implement the ability to relax this restriction
using Cross-Origin Resource Sharing<a id="fn-5-ref" href="#fn-5"
title="footnote 5" class="fnref">[5]</a>.
Thus, sites can explicitly allow cross-site downloading of WOFF files
using the <tt>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</tt> HTTP header.</p>

<p>User agents supporting the WOFF file format for downloadable fonts MUST respect
the requirements of the CSS Fonts specification<a id="fn-6-ref" href="#fn-6"
title="footnote 6" class="fnref">[6]</a>. In particular,
such downloaded fonts are only available to the documents that reference them;
they MUST NOT be made available to other applications or documents on the user's system.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>The WOFF format is intended for use with <tt>@font-face</tt> to provide
downloadable fonts linked to specific web pages.
It is therefore recommended that WOFF files should <strong>not</strong> be treated
as an installable font format in desktop operating systems or similar environments.
The WOFF-packaged data will typically be decoded to its original <tt>sfnt</tt> format
for use by existing font-rendering APIs that expect OpenType font data,
but such a decoded font should not be exposed as a file on disk,
and must not be installed "globally" for use by other processes
or documents on the system.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Notation">Notational Conventions</h3>

<p>The key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not", "should",
"should not", "recommended",  "may", and "optional" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119<a id="fn-7-ref" href="#fn-7"
title="footnote 7" class="fnref">[7]</a>.</p>



<h2 id="OverallStructure">2.&nbsp;Overall File Structure</h2>

<p>The structure of WOFF files is similar to the structure of sfnt-based fonts:
a table directory containing lengths and offsets to individual font data tables,
followed by the data tables themselves. The sfnt structure is described fully in
the TrueType<a href="#fn-1" title="footnote 1" class="fnref">[1]</a>, OpenType<a
href="#fn-2" title="footnote 2" class="fnref">[2]</a> and Open Font Format<a
href="#fn-3" title="footnote 3" class="fnref">[3]</a> specifications.</p>

<p>The main body of the file consists of the same collection of font data tables
as the original, uncompressed sfnt-based font, stored in the same order, except
that each table MAY be compressed, and the sfnt table directory is replaced by
the WOFF table directory.</p>

<p>A complete WOFF file consists of a 44-byte header, immediately followed (in
this order) by a variable-size table directory, a variable number of font
tables, an optional block of extended metadata, and an optional block of private
data. Except for padding with a maximum of three null bytes in places where 4-byte
alignment of a table length or data block is specified, there MUST NOT be any
extraneous data between the font tables and data blocks as pointed to by the header
and table directory entries, or beyond the last such table or data block.
If such extraneous data is present, a conforming user agent MUST reject the file as invalid.</p>

<table>
<col class="name"/><col class="desc"/>
<tr class="header"><th colspan="2">WOFF File</th></tr>
<tr><td>WOFFHeader</td><td>File header with basic font type and version, along
with offsets to metadata and private data blocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>TableDirectory</td><td>Directory of font tables, indicating the original
size, compressed size and location of each table within the WOFF file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>FontTables</td><td>The font data tables from the original sfnt-based
font, compressed to reduce bandwidth requirements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ExtendedMetadata</td><td>An optional block of extended metadata,
represented in XML format and compressed for storage in the WOFF file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>PrivateData</td><td>An optional block of private data for the font
designer, foundry, or vendor to use.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Data values stored in the WOFF Header and WOFF Table Directory sections are
stored in big-endian format, just as values are within sfnt-based fonts. The
following basic data types are used in the description:</p>
<table>
<col class="type"/><col class="desc"/>
<tr class="header"><th colspan="2">Data types</th></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>32-bit (4-byte) unsigned integer in big-endian
format</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt16</td><td>16-bit (2-byte) unsigned integer in big-endian
format</td></tr>
</table>

<p>All sizes and offsets described in this document are assumed to be in bytes unless
otherwise noted.</p>


<h2 id="WOFFHeader">3.&nbsp;WOFF Header</h2>

<p>The header includes an identifying signature and indicates the specific kind
of font data included in the file (TrueType or CFF outline data); it also has a
font version number, offsets to additional data chunks, and the number of
entries in the table directory that immediately follows the header:</p>

<table>
<col class="type"/><col class="name"/><col class="desc"/>
<tr class="header"><th colspan="3">WOFFHeader</th></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>signature</td><td>0x774F4646 <tt>'wOFF'</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>flavor</td><td>The "sfnt version" of the original file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>length</td><td>Total size of the WOFF file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt16</td><td>numTables</td><td>Number of entries in directory of font
tables.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt16</td><td>reserved</td><td>Reserved; set to zero.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>totalSfntSize</td><td>Total size needed for the
uncompressed font data, including the sfnt header, directory,
and font tables (including padding).</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt16</td><td>majorVersion</td><td>Major version of the WOFF
file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt16</td><td>minorVersion</td><td>Minor version of the WOFF
file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>metaOffset</td><td>Offset to metadata block, from
beginning of WOFF file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>metaLength</td><td>Length of compressed metadata block.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>metaOrigLength</td><td>Uncompressed size of metadata
block.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>privOffset</td><td>Offset to private data block, from
beginning of WOFF file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>privLength</td><td>Length of private data block.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The <tt>signature</tt> field in the WOFF header
MUST contain the "magic number" 0x774F4646.
If the field does not contain this value,
user agents MUST reject the file as invalid.</p>

<p>The <tt>flavor</tt> field corresponds to the "sfnt version"
field found at the beginning of an sfnt file,
indicating the type of font data contained.
Although only fonts of type 0x00010000 (the version number 1.0
as a 16.16 fixed-point value, indicating TrueType glyph data)
and 0x4F54544F (the tag <tt>'OTTO'</tt>, indicating CFF glyph data)
are widely supported at present, it is not an error in the WOFF file if the
<tt>flavor</tt> field contains a different value, indicating a
WOFF-packaged version of a different sfnt flavor. (The value 0x74727565 <tt>'true'</tt>
has been used for some TrueType-flavored fonts on Mac
OS, for example.) Whether client software will actually support other types of
sfnt-based font data is outside the scope of the WOFF specification, which
simply describes how the sfnt is repackaged for Web use.</p>

<p>The WOFF <tt>majorVersion</tt> and <tt>minorVersion</tt> fields specify the version number for a given
WOFF file, which can be based on the version number of the original font but is
not required to be. These fields have no effect on font loading or usage
behavior in user agents.</p>

<p>The <tt>totalSfntSize</tt> field is the sum of the
uncompressed font table sizes, each padded to a multiple of 4 bytes, plus
the size of the sfnt header and table directory. Thus, this is the size of
buffer needed to decode the complete WOFF-packaged font (but not metadata,
which is not part of the original sfnt file) into a standard sfnt structure.
Note that this value MUST be a multiple of 4, because all font tables
including the last are to be padded to a 4-byte boundary. If this value
is incorrect, a conforming user agent MUST reject the file as invalid.</p>

<p>If either or both of the metadata or private blocks is not present,
the relevant offset and length fields MUST be set to zero.
If the offset and length fields pointing to the metadata or private data block
are out of range, indicating a byte range beyond the physical size
of the file, a conforming user agent MUST reject the file as invalid.</p>

<p>The header includes a <tt>reserved</tt> field; this MUST be
set to zero. If this field is non-zero, a conforming user agent
MUST reject the file as invalid.</p>


<h2 id="TableDirectory">4.&nbsp;Table Directory</h2>

<p>The table directory is an array of WOFF table directory entries, as defined
below. The directory follows immediately after the WOFF file header; therefore,
there is no explicit offset in the header pointing to this block. Its size is
calculated by multiplying the <tt>numTables</tt> value in the
WOFF header times the size of a single WOFF table directory.  Each table
directory entry specifies the size and location of a single font data table.</p>

<table>
<col class="type"/><col class="name"/><col class="desc"/>
<tr class="header"><th colspan="3">WOFF TableDirectoryEntry</th></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>tag</td><td>4-byte sfnt table identifier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>offset</td><td>Offset to the data, from beginning of WOFF
file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>compLength</td><td>Length of the compressed data,
excluding padding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>origLength</td><td>Length of the uncompressed table,
excluding padding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>UInt32</td><td>origChecksum</td><td>Checksum of the uncompressed
table.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The format of <tt>tag</tt> values are defined by the
specifications for sfnt-based fonts. The <tt>offset</tt> and
<tt>compLength</tt> fields identify the location of the
compressed font table. The <tt>origLength</tt> and <tt>origCheckSum</tt>
fields are the length and checksum of the
original, uncompressed font table from the table directory of the original
font.</p>

<p>The sfnt-based format specifications require that font tables be aligned on
4-byte boundaries. Font tables whose length is not a multiple of 4 are padded
with null bytes up to the next 4-byte boundary. Font data tables in the WOFF
file have the same requirement: they MUST begin on 4-byte boundaries and be
zero-padded to the next 4-byte boundary. The <tt>compLength</tt> and <tt>origLength</tt> fields
in the header store the exact, unpadded length.</p>

<p>If the length of a compressed font table would be the same as or greater than
the length of the original font table, the font table MUST be stored
uncompressed in the WOFF file and the <tt>compLength</tt> set
equal to the <tt>origLength</tt>. Tools MAY also opt to leave
other tables uncompressed (e.g. all tables less than a certain size), in which
case <tt>compLength</tt> will be equal to <tt>origLength</tt> for these tables as well.
WOFF files containing
table directory entries for which <tt>compLength</tt> is
greater than <tt>origLength</tt> are considered invalid and
MUST NOT be loaded by user agents. Files containing compressed font tables that
decompress to a size larger than <tt>origLength</tt> are also
considered invalid and MUST NOT be loaded.</p>

<p>The sfnt-based font specifications require that table directory entries
are sorted in ascending order of <tt>tag</tt> value. To
simplify processing, WOFF-producing tools MUST produce a table directory with
entries in ascending <tt>tag</tt> value order. User agents MUST
likewise assure that the sfnt table directory is recreated in ascending
<tt>tag</tt> order when restoring the font data to its uncompressed
state. The ordering of the font tables themselves is independent of the order of
directory entries, as described below.</p>

<p>sfnt-based fonts store a checksum for each table in the table directory, and
an overall checksum for the entire font in the <tt>head</tt>
table (see the TrueType, OpenType or Open Font Format specifications for the
definition of each calculation). Tools producing WOFF files MUST validate these
checksums, and reject the font if errors are found.</p>

<p>A WOFF file contains the same set of font tables as the original font
from which it was created. This means that the overall font checksum of a
font decompressed from a conformant WOFF file should always match the checksum
in the original, valid sfnt-based font file, except in the case where the
original file included unreferenced data between or after the actual tables;
this would affect the overall checksum of the original font, but would be
dropped during creation of the WOFF file.</p>

<p>Unless the original font has structural anomalies such as
incorrect padding, overlapping font tables, or
extraneous data between tables (which will be discarded by the WOFF
generator), the result of creating a WOFF file and then decoding this to
regenerate an sfnt font MUST result in a final font that is bitwise-identical to
the original.
In the event that the original sfnt has defects or anomalies
that make this impossible,
the WOFF-generating tool SHOULD either reject the font
or issue an appropriate warning
that lossless round-trip conversion will not be possible.</p>


<h2 id="DataTables">5.&nbsp;Font Data Tables</h2>

<p>The font data tables in the WOFF file are exactly the same as the tables in
the original sfnt-based font file, except that each table MAY have been
compressed by the <tt>compress2()</tt> function of zlib<a
id="fn-8-ref" href="#fn-8" title="footnote 8" class="fnref">[8]</a> (or an
equivalent, compatible algorithm). User agents use a function equivalent to the
<tt>uncompress</tt> function of zlib<a id="fn-9-ref"
href="#fn-9" title="footnote 9" class="fnref">[9]</a> to decompress each table.
The underlying format these functions use is described in the ZLIB
specification<a id="fn-10-ref" href="#fn-10" title="footnote 10"
class="fnref">[10]</a>.</p>

<p>User agents or other programs that decode WOFF files MUST be able to handle
tables that have been compressed. However, the use of compression for font data
tables is OPTIONAL for tools generating WOFF files; storing some or all of the tables in
uncompressed form is permissible.</p>

<p>The font data tables MUST be stored immediately following the table
directory, without gaps except for the padding that may be required (up to three
null bytes at the end of each table) to ensure 4-byte alignment.</p>

<p>Font tables in WOFF files MUST be stored in the same order as the original
sfnt-based font;
this is necessary to enable the reconstruction of an sfnt that is
not just functionally equivalent but actually bitwise-identical to the original.
The table order is implied by <tt>offset</tt> values in the table directory; sorting table
directory entries into ascending <tt>offset</tt> value order
produces a list of entries in an order equivalent to that of the font tables.
User agents MAY reorder tables when decoding the WOFF file to sfnt form,
but should be aware that this means the resulting sfnt will no longer be
an exact copy of the original, and checksums or digital signature data
may be invalidated as a result.
(Note that user agents need not necessarily reconstitute the original sfnt
as a whole; they may access individual tables directly as needed.)</p>

<div class="note">
<p>In some cases, sites deploying WOFF files as web fonts may wish to subset the character
repertoire, optimize table ordering for efficient text layout or rasterization,
or remove (or add) optional font tables depending on the particular features needed for a site.
User agents might make similar modifications to the font during decoding,
such as omitting tables that are not needed by their particular text display system.</p>

<p>If either a WOFF-creation tool or a WOFF-consuming user agent
reorders or otherwise modifies the collection of font tables,
the font checksum in the <tt>head</tt> table will need to be recalculated
as it will be affected by the changed offsets in
the sfnt table directory.
Any <tt>DSIG</tt> table in the original font will also be invalidated by such changes, and should therefore be removed from the modified font.
A new signature could be added to the modified font,
as described by the OpenType and Open Font Format specifications
(if appropriate signing credentials are available to the tool involved).
Any such pre- and/or post-processing
represents a modification of the font data being packaged;
while it might be done in conjunction with WOFF packaging for Web deployment,
it falls outside the scope of the WOFF specification.</p>

<p>To ensure that lossless round-trip conversion from sfnt to WOFF and back
will be possible, it is recommended that the original sfnt file should conform
to certain norms that are not
strictly required by the OpenType/OFF specification, although they are common
practice:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Font table padding</dt>
<dd>The OpenType/OFF specification is not entirely clear about whether <em>all</em>
tables in an sfnt font must be padded with 0-3 zero bytes to a multiple
of 4 bytes in length, or whether this applies only <em>between</em> tables,
and the final table of the file may be left unpadded.
Most current tools and fonts seem to expect all tables to be padded to a 4-byte
boundary, including the last.
The WOFF specification assumes this behavior, and specifies that the
<tt>totalSfntLength</tt> field in the WOFF header provides for such padding.
To ensure that a given font can be packaged as a WOFF file and then decoded
to its original format and give a byte-for-byte identical result,
the input font should therefore be padded to a multiple of 4 bytes in length.</dd>

<dt>No "hidden" data</dt>
<dd>The OpenType/OFF specification does not explicitly prohibit the
presence of "extra" data or padding in between the font tables;
as the table directory includes the offset and length of each actual table,
such data would simply be ignored. However, the WOFF format makes no
provision to preserve such non-font-table data when packaging a font,
and therefore it would not survive a round-trip format conversion.</dd>

<dt>Ensure checksums are correct</dt>
<dd>The WOFF specification says that table checksums must be validated
(and corrected if necessary) by WOFF creators.
In order for complete
round-trip fidelity, therefore, the checksums in the original sfnt file
must also be correct prior to WOFF packaging.</dd>
</dl>
</div>

<h2 id="Metadata">6.&nbsp;Extended Metadata Block</h2>

<p>The WOFF file MAY include a block of extended metadata, allowing the
inclusion of more extensive metadata than is present directly in the original
sfnt-based font file. The metadata block consists of XML data compressed by
zlib; the file header specifies both the size of the actual compressed and the
original uncompressed size in order to facilitate memory allocation.</p>

<p>The presence (or absence) and content of the metadata block
MUST NOT affect font loading or rendering behavior of user agents;
it is intended to be purely informative.
User agents MAY provide a means for users to view information about fonts
(such as a "Font Information" panel). If such information is provided,
then they MUST treat the metadata block as the primary source,
and MAY fall back to presenting information from the font's <tt>name</tt>
table entries when relevant extended metadata elements are not present.</p>

<p>If present, the metadata MUST be compressed; it is never stored in
uncompressed form.</p>

<p>The metadata block MUST follow immediately after the last font table. As font
tables MUST be padded with null bytes to a 4-byte boundary, the beginning of the
metadata block will always be 4-byte aligned.
If the metadata block is followed by a private data block (see below),
the end of the metadata block MUST be padded with null bytes to a 4-byte boundary.
If the metadata block is not followed by a private data block,
it MUST either be padded with null bytes to the next 4-byte boundary,
or contain no additional padding after the end of the block.</p>

<p>The extended metadata MUST be well-formed XML encoded in UTF-8 or UTF-16.
The use of UTF-8 encoding is recommended.</p>

<p>The schema for the extended metadata XML is described below.
If the extended metadata does not match this schema,
it is invalid and MUST be ignored, as if the block were not present.</p>

<p>Several elements store their data in <tt>text</tt>
subelements; this is to support localization. The <tt>text</tt>
elements MAY be given a <tt>lang</tt> attribute. The possible
values for the <tt>lang</tt> attribute can be found in the IANA
Subtag Registry<a id="fn-11-ref" href="#fn-11" title="footnote 11"
class="fnref">[11]</a>. A user agent displaying metadata is expected to choose a
preferred language/locale to display from among those available, following RFC 4647<a
id="fn-12-ref" href="#fn-12" title="footnote 12" class="fnref">[12]</a>.
The user agent SHOULD choose which of the available <tt>text</tt>
elements to display as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>If a <tt>text</tt> element is available in the user's
preferred language, as determined via
an explicit preference or implied by the current locale, use this language.</li>
<li>If the user agent has a concept of a list of "acceptable" languages or
defaults, try each of these in turn and use the first one found.</li>
<li>If there is a <tt>text</tt> element with no <tt>lang</tt>
attribute, use this; in the event that more than one exists, use the first of them.</li>
<li>If no match is found yet, use the first <tt>text</tt> element.
(Thus, the metadata creator can determine the "localization of last resort"
simply by choosing which language to put first in each group of
<tt>text</tt> elements.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Such localizable elements are
indicated by the statement "This element may be localized" in the description
below; the internal structure of <tt>text</tt> elements with
<tt>lang</tt> attributes is not repeated for each element
type.</p>

<p><a href="#appendix-a">Appendix A</a> includes several examples
of the content of the metadata block.</p>


<h2 id="Private">7.&nbsp;Private Data Block</h2>

<p>The WOFF file MAY include a block of arbitrary data, allowing font creators
to include whatever information they wish. The content of this data MUST NOT
affect font usage or load behavior of user agents.
User agents should make no assumptions
about the content of a private block; it may (for example) contain ASCII or
Unicode text, or some vendor-defined binary data, and it may be compressed or
encrypted, but it has no publicly defined format. Conformant user agents will
not assume anything about the structure of this data. Only the font developer or
vendor responsible for the private block is expected to understand its
contents.</p>

<p>The private data block, if present, MUST be the last block in the WOFF file,
following all the font tables and any extended metadata block. The private data
block MUST begin on a 4-byte boundary in the WOFF file, with up to three null
bytes inserted as padding if needed to ensure this.
After the end of the private data block,
the file MUST either be padded with null bytes to the next 4-byte boundary,
or contain no additional padding after the end of the block.</p>


<h2 id="Conformance">8.&nbsp;Summary of Conformance Requirements</h2>

<p>This section summarizes key conformance requirements for WOFF files,
derived from the more detailed specifications above.
Tools creating WOFF files MUST ensure that the results conform to these requirements,
and unless otherwise specified here,
user agents processing or using WOFF files MUST reject any non-conforming input files.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>The WOFF specification does not guarantee that the actual font data
packaged in a valid WOFF container is in fact correct and usable.
It requires only that the WOFF packaging structure&#x2014;header, table directory,
and compressed tables&#x2014;conforms to this specification.
The contained data must be used with just as much caution as font data
delivered in "raw" form or via any other packaging method.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="conformance-woff-header">WOFF header</h3>

<dl>
<dt>signature</dt>
<dd>MUST be the value 0x774F4646</dd>
<dt>length</dt>
<dd>MUST match the total length of the WOFF file</dd>
<dt>reserved</dt>
<dd>MUST be zero</dd>
<dt>offset and length of metadata and private blocks</dt>
<dd>MUST be zero, or point to valid ranges of the WOFF file</dd>
<dt>totalSfntLength</dt>
<dd>MUST match the total size required for the decoded sfnt data,
including header, table directory, decompressed tables,
and padding of all table lengths to 4-byte boundaries</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="conformance-woff-directory">WOFF directory</h3>
<p>The table directory entries MUST be in ascending order according to table tag.
Within each entry:</p>
<dl>
<dt>compLength</dt>
<dd>MUST be less than or equal to origLength</dd>
<dt>origChecksum</dt>
<dd>MUST be correct for the original table data, in accordance with the OpenType specification.
However, user agents are not required to validate these checskums;
they are merely reinserted into the sfnt table directory
when reconstructing the original font data.</dd>
<dt>offset</dt>
<dd>MUST be a multiple of 4</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="conformance-font-tables">Font tables</h3>
<p>For each table where (in the WOFF table directory)
<tt>compLength &lt; origLength</tt>,
processing the data with zlib's <tt>uncompress()</tt>
function MUST result in exactly <tt>origLength</tt> bytes of
decompressed data.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>User agents decoding WOFF files should be careful to check all uncompress
operations for overflow or underflow of the length of decompressed data compared
to the specified <tt>origLength</tt>, and to reject the WOFF file in case
of any mismatch.</p>
</div>
<p>For each table where <tt>compLength</tt> is not a multiple of 4,
the WOFF file MUST be padded with up to 3 zero bytes so as to reach a 4-byte boundary.</p>
<p>User agents MUST NOT load WOFF files that contain extraneous data
between font tables.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>The OpenType/OFF specification does not explicitly prohibit the
presence of "extra" data or padding in between the font tables in the sfnt format;
as the table directory includes the offset and length of each actual table,
such data would simply be ignored. However, the WOFF format makes no
provision to preserve such "hidden" non-font-table data when packaging a font,
and therefore it would not survive a round-trip format conversion.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="conformance-metadata">Metadata</h3>
<p>Processing the metadata with zlib's  <tt>uncompress()</tt> function
MUST result in <tt>metaOrigLength</tt> bytes of decompressed data.</p>

<p>The decompressed data MUST be well-formed XML;
however, if the metadata block is not well-formed,
user agents MUST NOT reject the entire WOFF file.
They MAY provide some form of warning or error indication to the user,
but MUST proceed to render the contained font as if the metadata block were absent.
This requirement is designed to maximize interoperability between clients
that interpret the metadata block and those that do not support it at all.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>Although the metadata block is optional,
and there is no requirement for user agents to process it
in order to render the font,
clients such as web browsers are encouraged to provide a means
(such as a "Font Information" dialog for the current page)
for users to view the metadata included in WOFF files.
Not every client will necessarily have an appropriate context for this,
but any client that enables the user to find out about the resources used by a web page
should consider exposing information about the fonts used, and in the case of
WOFF-packaged fonts, the metadata block is the primary source of this information.</p>

The test cases here are generated by the Python scripts in the generators directory. The scripts have the following dependencies:

	FontTools http://fontTools.sf.net
	NumPy http://numpy.scipy.org

The User Agent tests are set up in reftest format following the CSS Test specifications (http://wiki.csswg.org/test/css2.1/format).

All of this is a work in progress and should not be considered final in any way.

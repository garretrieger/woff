validsfnt-001		Valid CFF SFNT		#conform-checksumvalidate	DUMMY		The CFF flavored SFNT data is valid.
validsfnt-002		Valid TTF SFNT		#conform-checksumvalidate	DUMMY		The TTF flavored SFNT data is valid.
invalidsfnt-checksum-001		Table Directory Contains Invalid CheckSum		#conform-checksumvalidate	DUMMY		The checksum for the OS/2 table is set to 0.
invalidsfnt-checksum-002		Font head Table Incorrect CheckSum Adjustment		#conform-checksumvalidate	DUMMY		The head table checksum adjustment is set to 0.
invalidsfnt-padding-001		Table Data Missing Padding		#conform-incorrect-reject	DUMMY		There is no padding between two tables. The head check sum adjustment is also incorrect as a result.
invalidsfnt-padding-002		Final Table in Table Data Is Not Padded		#conform-incorrect-reject	DUMMY		There is no padding after the final table.
invalidsfnt-padding-003		Unnecessary Padding Between Tables		#conform-incorrect-reject	DUMMY		There are four extra bytes after the head table. The head check sum adjustment is also incorrect as a result.
invalidsfnt-padding-004		Unnecessary Padding After Final Table		#conform-incorrect-reject	DUMMY		There are four extra bytes after the final table. The head check sum adjustment is also incorrect as a result.
invalidsfnt-padding-005		Invalid Padding Bytes in Table Data		#conform-incorrect-reject	DUMMY		There is padding after the head table that is not null.
invalidsfnt-blocks-001		Table Data Blocks Overlap		#conform-incorrect-reject	DUMMY		Two table blocks overlap.
invalidsfnt-blocks-002		Table Data Block Begins Before End Of Directory		#conform-incorrect-reject	DUMMY		The first table has an offset that is before the end of the table directory.
invalidsfnt-blocks-003		Table Data Block Offset + Length Extends Past End of File		#conform-incorrect-reject	DUMMY		The final table has an offset + length that is four bytes past the end of the file.
invalidsfnt-directory-order-001		Table Directory Not In Ascending Order		#conform-incorrect-reject	DUMMY		The table directory is in descending order.
invalidsfnt-searchrange-001		Invalid searchRange		#conform-incorrect-reject	DUMMY		The searchRange is set to 0.
invalidsfnt-entryselector-001		Invalid entrySelector		#conform-incorrect-reject	DUMMY		The entrySelector is set to 0.
invalidsfnt-rangeshift-001		Invalid rangeShift		#conform-incorrect-reject	DUMMY		The rangeShift is set to 0.
tabledata-compression-size-001		The "TEST" Table Must Not Be Compressed		#conform-compressedlarger	DUMMY		The "TEST" table will be larger when compressed so it must not be compressed.
tabledirectory-ascending-001		The Table Directory Must Be In Ascending Order		#conform-ascending	DUMMY		The SFNT contains 1AAA, 2AAA, A1AA, A2AA, AA1A, AA2A, AAA1, AAA2, AAAA, AAAB, AABA, ABAA, BAAA, 8ZZZ, 9ZZZ, Z8ZZ, Z9ZZ, ZZ8Z, ZZ9Z, ZZZ8, ZZZ9, YZZZ, ZYZZ, ZZYZ, ZZZY, ZZZZ, 1aaa, 2aaa, a1aa, a2aa, aa1a, aa2a, aaa1, aaa2, aaaa, aaab, aaba, abaa, baaa, 8zzz, 9zzz, z8zz, z9zz, zz8z, zz9z, zzz8, zzz9, yzzz, zyzz, zzyz, zzzy, zzzz tables in addition to the standard tables. The result of conversion to WOFF should be checked to ensure that the directory is in ascending order.
bitwiseidentical-001		SFNT With Common CFF Structure		#conform-identical	DUMMY		The SFNT has a common CFF structure. The process of converting to WOFF and back to SFNT should result in a file that is bitwise identical.
bitwiseidentical-002		SFNT With Common TTF Structure		#conform-identical	DUMMY		The SFNT has a common TTF structure. The process of converting to WOFF and back to SFNT should result in a file that is bitwise identical.
bitwiseidentical-003		SFNT With Uncommon Table		#conform-identical	DUMMY		The SFNT has a DSIG table. (Note: this is not a valid DSIG. It should not be used for testing anything other than the presence of the table after the conversion process.) The process of converting to WOFF and back to SFNT should result in a file that is bitwise identical.
bitwiseidentical-004		SFNT With Non-Standard Table		#conform-identical	DUMMY		The SFNT has a TEST table. The process of converting to WOFF and back to SFNT should result in a file that is bitwise identical.
bitwiseidentical-005		SFNT Without Recommended CFF Table Order		#conform-identical	DUMMY		The SFNT has a table order that does not follow the recommended CFF table ordering as defined in the OpenType specification. The process of converting to WOFF and back to SFNT should result in a file that is bitwise identical.
bitwiseidentical-006		SFNT Without Recommended TTF Table Order		#conform-identical	DUMMY		The SFNT has a table order that does not follow the recommended TTF table ordering as defined in the OpenType specification. The process of converting to WOFF and back to SFNT should result in a file that is bitwise identical.
